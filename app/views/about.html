                    <h2>A little bit about me .. </h2>
                    <p>
                        Sitting somewhere between the conceptual and practical, my focus is on the pervasive Internet
                        and emerging technology. Iâ€™ve worked for the largest companies in the world, the smallest
                        startups, and everything in between: helping them develop products, services and communications
                        that combine networked software with the physical world in ways that make sense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a unique business sense out of my major academic studies, combined with a natural talent
                        and full crowded 9+ years of hands-on commercial experience.
                    </p>
