                <h2>A little bit about me .. </h2>
                <p>
                    Sitting somewhere between the conceptual and practical, my focus is on the pervasive Internet and emerging technology. Iâ€™ve worked for the largest companies in the world, the smallest startups, and everything in between: helping them develop products, services and communications that combine networked software with the physical world in ways that make sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have my own unique business sense out of my major academic studies, combined with a natural talent and full crowded 9+ years of hands-on commercial experience.
